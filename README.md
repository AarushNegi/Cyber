## 📖 Overview

ZeroKey Auth is a passwordless authentication system designed to replace traditional passwords with secure cryptographic authentication methods.

The project implements the FIDO2/WebAuthn standard and provides a modern authentication platform capable of:

- Passkey authentication
- Windows Hello support
- Biometric authentication
- Google OAuth SSO
- JWT-based session management
- Audit logging
- Account lockout protection
- Risk-based authentication

The goal is to eliminate password-related attacks while improving user experience and reducing IT support costs.

## 🔒 Access Notice

Registration is currently closed as this is a controlled security research deployment.

This is intentional — ZeroKey uses a registration lock feature to prevent unauthorised account creation on the live instance.

To explore the project locally, clone the repo and set `REGISTRATION_OPEN=true` in your `.env` file.
## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional authentication systems suffer from:

- Weak passwords
- Password reuse
- Credential stuffing
- Phishing attacks
- Brute-force attacks
- Password database breaches

ZeroKey replaces passwords with public-key cryptography and passkeys, ensuring that no reusable secret is transmitted during authentication.

## 🔄 Authentication Flow

### Registration

1. User creates an account.
2. Server generates a challenge.
3. Browser invokes WebAuthn.
4. Authenticator creates a key pair.
5. Public key is stored in MongoDB.
6. Private key never leaves the device.

### Login

1. User enters username.
2. Server generates a challenge.
3. Windows Hello / Passkey signs challenge.
4. Server verifies signature.
5. JWT token is issued.
6. User gains access.

## 🛡 Security Features

### Audit Logging

Every authentication event is logged:

- Login Success
- Login Failure
- Logout
- Passkey Registration
- Passkey Deletion
- Google Authentication Events

### Risk Engine

Risk scoring based on:

- New IP addresses
- Unusual login times
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Recently locked accounts

### Account Lockout

- Locks account after repeated failed attempts
- Automatic unlock timer
- Prevents brute-force attacks
